                        First thing to be discussed here is the Headset you mostly see the football coaches wearing it.
                        Wheter
                        they use it to communicate or slam the ground, its up to them but either way, it's a great
                        technology
                        that football has to offer. There are countless applications, all of which are beneficial. With the
                        headset, coaches in the press box can see aerial views of the game and communicate information to
                        the
                        head coach who may not be able to see it from ground level.Another common exchange that takes place
                        with
                        the headpiece is between coaches and players on the sidelines. After all, the man in the box is able
                        to
                        see formations and tendencies that the quarterback is unable to see from behind the center. In
                        professional football, the quarterback and defensive coordinator can wear a speaker in their
                        helmets,
                        removing the barrier of crowd noise and reducing confusion caused by messenger calls.

                        Quite literally, a lifesaver.
                        Heart monitors are helpful to everyone from the average jogger to today's elite athletes. If used to
                        target a specific heart rate, these devices play a significant role in progressing a workout
                        plan. Athletes would have a hard time keeping track of their exercise program's progress and
                        sustainability without a heart monitor.
                        Athletes can also be warned of malnutrition and dehydration with some heart monitors. The most
                        important
                        piece of technology in sports today is a simple wrist or strap-on mechanism that can warn people of
                        unsafe workouts or play a crucial role in every exercise session. Technology that can improve the
                        sound
                        of games is cool and useful, but it's hard to argue with anything that simultaneously encourages
                        progress and safety.

                        Some may argue that this should be followed by a homerun review; however, given that baseball is a
                        very traditional sport and homerun reviews rarely occur, the radar gun is chosen for baseball.
                        The pitcher's team and the batters on the other team record and analyze each pitch speed.Pitch speed
                        can make or break a pitcher's chances of reaching the Major Leagues, and the radar gun lets pitchers
                        and their teams monitor their progress.
                        The radar gun is probably used more by hitters than by pitchers because hitters can use it to look
                        at the other starting pitcher and even test their bat speed just like pitchers would test their
                        pitching speed.
