                    <h3>Football Headset</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    On the sidelines, football coaches frequently wear either a single earpiece or a complete headset
                    with two earpieces. Why are these coaches using a headset and who are they talking to?
                    When communicating with other coaches in higher positions, such as booths or the stands, football
                    coaches wear headsets. Because they have a better view of the game, these coaches relay information
                    to the coaches on the field.
                    On Friday (for games against high schools), Saturday (for games against colleges), and Sunday (for
                    games against the NFL), coaches can be seen pacing the sideline while wearing headsets

                        Benefit of using headset
                    </h3>

                    Headsets wore by football referees are solving one major problem. That is 'Communication'. Headsets
                    connect coaches at a higher elevation point, typically a "booth," to coaches on the field. In high
                    school football, coaches may find themselves tucked in the corner of the stands or even above the
                    press box for a better view. From the sidelines, coaches can't get a good look at the offense or
                    defense from the right angle. That's the bird's-eye view the coaches want, just like you see on TV.
                    This perspective aids coaches in dissecting the plan and quickly determining which player is not
                    performing their duties.

                        How to use the headset
                    </h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    On every play, coaches communicate with the quarterback, who directs the offense, and one defensive
                    player, who directs the defense. In order to listen to the coaches, the quarterback and defensive
                    players wear radio frequency helmets. However, the helmet of the quarterback and the defenseman can
                    only receive radio signals and cannot converse with their coach. A quarterback can talk to a coach
                    between plays and up to 15 seconds before the clock runs out. When NFL teams go on the offensive
                    field, they typically have a playbook in mind, so communication tends to build off of that strategy.

                        Who uses these headsets
                    </h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The Cleveland Browns' George Ratterman was the first player to wear a radio helmet while playing
                    football in 1956.The use of a radio transmitter to communicate during football games was outlawed by
                    the NFL commissioner, Bert Bell, three preseason games after George began wearing the radio helmet.
                    The league deemed it cheating because only the Cleveland Browns were using the headset. In 1994, the
                    NFL granted permission for all NFL teams to use Motorola headsets for communication. The idea behind
                    the headset was to make it easier for coaches and players to communicate with one another, resulting
                    in a better product for fans to watch. Because no players had to run to the sidelines to hear each
                    play, headset communication sped up the action on the field.

                    The Headset is a breakthrough in the live event and sports intercom markets, where noise is
                    prevalent, thanks to its active noise cancellation design. When compared to conventional passive
                    headsets, this headset offers significantly improved comfort, crystal-clear audio, and increased
                    noise reduction. In aviation headsets, Bose has used active noise cancellation for a long time.
